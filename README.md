# Serpentia - 3D Online Multiplayer Snake Game

Serpentia is an exciting 3D online multiplayer snake game where two players can join the game. One player controls the snake, and the other controls the rat (food). The objective is simple: the snake has to eat the rat, while the rat must try to escape from the snake. The game leverages Three.js for rendering 3D elements, Socket.io for real-time communication between game clients and servers, and Nest.js for handling the backend.
